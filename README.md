# RobotDNN

This repository contains code and schemas to build robots "Intelligent"
with a first approach to neural networks for object recognition and faces recognition with dlib, all controlled remotely with a small C++ interface with openframeworks.

The control application provides interaction with multiple robots at the same time.


In the future I will also add:<br>
	autonomous path planning<br>
        obstacles recognition<br>

In a short time you will find a guide here:<br>
